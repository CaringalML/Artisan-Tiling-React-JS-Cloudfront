terraform init
```

2. Review planned changes:
```bash
terraform plan
```

3. Apply infrastructure:
```bash
terraform apply
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, triggered on:
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Build Environment Setup
- Runs on Ubuntu latest
- Uses Node.js 20.x
- Utilizes npm cache for faster builds

#### 2. Dependencies Management
- Checks for existing node_modules
- Automatically installs dependencies if missing
- Uses `npm ci` for clean installs

#### 3. Environment Configuration
- Creates `.env` file from GitHub Secrets
- Configures environment variables

#### 4. Build Process
- Builds the React application
- Uses environment variables from secrets
- Generates production-ready assets

#### 5. AWS Deployment
- Configures AWS credentials from secrets
- Syncs build files to S3 bucket
- Invalidates CloudFront cache

### Required Secrets

Configure in GitHub repository settings:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID          - AWS IAM access key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY      - AWS IAM secret key
VITE_API_URL              - Backend API URL
CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID - CloudFront distribution ID
```
